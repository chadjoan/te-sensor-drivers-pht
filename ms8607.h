/**
 * \brief    This structure allows the caller to provide implementations for the
 *           MS8607 driver's dependencies, which are mostly I2C functionality.
 *
 * \details  Some patterns are employed to keep the driver and callbacks
 *           flexible and thread-safe:
 *    - A `caller_context` pointer is passed from the caller into the MS8607
 *        driver, and then from the MS8607 driver into these callbacks. This is
 *        what allows the caller and their callbacks to communicate and persist
 *        data accross calls into the driver (and to do so without relying on
 *        global variables or thread-local-storage).
 *    - The return value is usually the `ms8607_status` enum, but only one of
 *        two possible enum values shall be returned from the callback:
 *        `ms8607_status_ok` and `ms8607_status_error_within_callback`.
 *    - Returning `ms8607_status_ok` indicates that the callback completed its
 *        operation (usually an I2C transaction) successfully. This tells the
 *        driver that it can continue working.
 *    - Returning `ms8607_status_error_within_callback` indicates that something
 *        went wrong. The driver will typically return from its own function
 *        immediately after receiving this error code from a callback. This
 *        is intended primarily as a way to provide the driver with "go / no-go"
 *        information, and nothing more specific than that. If the caller needs
 *        to return more specific error details from a failed callback,
 *        the `caller_context` argument should be used for this purpose.
