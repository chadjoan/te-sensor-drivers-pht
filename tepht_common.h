// Below is part of an abandoned-but-tempting way to store debug information
// in a compiler-and-platform-agnostic manner. However, getting it to work
// in a way that's both efficient and safe (ex: for critical software) might
// require static analysis tools, and using those static analysis tools as
// part of the project's build process (e.g. to learn how many functions
// there are and how many times we might need to store {line,file,func} rows).

// Current proces for sizing this parameter is to run this command from this
// project's directory:
//   grep -P '\b([a-zA-Z0-9]+)_(error|success)\b' ./* | wc -l
// This will count all instances of things like `ms8607_error(...)`, since
// every appearance of that macro can potentially add one row to this database.
// The pathological scenario is that some program manages to somehow get
// every single error in the library to be emitted, which would add a row
// for every one of those instances. If we can still have space left over
// even after that happens, then we will never run out.
